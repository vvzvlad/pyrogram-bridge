# Testing Guidelines

- **Location:** Tests are located in the `tests/` directory.
- **Execution:**
  - To run tests for the post parser, use the command: `pytest tests/test_post_parser.py`
  - To run all tests in the project, use: `pytest tests/` 

You should run the tests yourself with the `pytest tests/` command, not ask the user to run them
After that, you have to analyze the test results and if they fall down, keep fixing the code or tests depending on the task context
